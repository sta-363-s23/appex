## Part 1

Draw an example of a partition of a two-dimensional feature space that could result from recursive binary splitting with six regions. Label your figure with the regions, $R_1, \dots, R_6$ as well as the cutpoints $t_1, t_2, \dots$. Draw a decision tree corresponding to this partition. 

## Part 2

1. How many internal nodes does this plot have? How many terminal nodes?
2. What is the average Salary for players who have more than 6.5 years in the major leagues but less than 118 Hits? What % of the dataset fall in this category?

## Part 3

Using the `College` data from the `ISLR` package, predict the number of applications received from a subset of the variables of your choice using a decision tree. (Not sure about the variables? Run `?College` in the console after loading the `ISLR` package)
