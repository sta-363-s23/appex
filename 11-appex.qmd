## Part 1

1. Examine the `Hitters` dataset by running `?Hitters` in the Console
2. We want to predict a major league player's `Salary` from all of the other 19 variables in this dataset. Create a visualization of `Salary`.
3. Create a recipe to estimate this model.
4. Add a preprocessing step to your recipe, scaling each of the predictors

## Part 2

1. Add a preprocessing step to your recipe to convert nominal variables into indicators
2. Add a step to your recipe to remove missing values for the outcome
3. Add a step to your recipe to impute missing values for the predictors using the average for the remaining values **NOTE THIS IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS WE WILL LEARN BETTER TECHNIQUES!**

## Part 3

1. Set a seed `set.seed(1)`
2. Create a cross validation object for the `Hitters` dataset
3. Using the recipe from the previous exercise, fit the model using Ridge regression with a penalty $\lambda$ = 300
4. What is the estimate of the test RMSE for this model?

## Part 4

1. Using the `Hitters` cross validation object and recipe created in the previous exercise, use `tune_grid` to pick the optimal penalty and mixture values.
2. Update the code below to create a grid that includes penalties from 0 to 50 by 1 and mixtures from 0 to 1 by 0.5.
3. Use this grid in the `tune_grid` function. Then use `collect_metrics` and filter to only include the RSME estimates.
4. Create a figure to examine the estimated test RMSE for the grid of penalty and mixture values -- which should you choose?

## Part 5

1. Using the final model specification, extract the coefficients from the model by creating a `workflow`
2. Filter out any coefficients exactly equal to 0
